# Competitive Programming Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming exercises. The solutions are implemented in C++ and are designed to help developers practice and improve their skills in algorithms and data structures.

## Requirements

To run test cases and verify solutions, you will need the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight and powerful source code editor that can be customized with extensions.
- **CP-H Judge**: A tool that allows you to run and verify test cases for competitive programming exercises.

## Setup

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install CP-H Judge**:
   - Follow the instructions on [CP-H Judge](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) to install and configure the tool.

3. **Configure Visual Studio Code**:
   - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
   - Make sure the C++ extension is installed (you can search for "C++" in the VS Code extensions tab).

4. **Run Test Cases**:
   - Open the exercise file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Use CP-H Judge to run the test cases. Generally, this will involve setting up a tasks file in VS Code to execute the programs and check the outputs against expected results.
